# #FRONTEND CHALLENGE
## Frontend Mentor - 3-column preview card component solution
To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.
The challenge is to build out this 3-column preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## Building the project
WORK FLOW

1. Initialized the project as a public repository on Github. 
2. Configured the repository to publish my code to a web address. 
3. Looked through the designs to start planning out how I will tackle the project.
4. Before adding any styles, I structured my content with HTML. Writing my HTML first helps focus my attention on creating well-structured content.
5. Wrote out the base styles for the project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
6. Started adding styles to the top of the page and work down. 

Depolyed the project on GitHub Pages.
